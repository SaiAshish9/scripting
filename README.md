# Bash Vs Shell Scripting

```
Shell is an interface between a user and OS to access to an operating system's services. It can be either GUI or CLI (Command Line interface).

sh (Bourne shell) is a shell command-line interpreter, for Unix/Unix-like operating systems. It provides some built-in commands. In scripting language we denote interpreter as #!/bin/sh. It was one most widely supported by other shells like bash (free/open), kash (not free).

Bash (Bourne again shell) is a shell replacement for the Bourne shell. Bash is superset of sh. Bash supports sh. POSIX is a set of standards defining how POSIX-compliant systems should work. Bash is not actually a POSIX compliant shell. In a scripting language we denote the interpreter as #!/bin/bash.
